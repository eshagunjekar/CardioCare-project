              <h2 style="font-size: 18px"> When to see Doctors</h2>
              <p>See your doctor if you think you might be experiencing signs or symptoms of heart failure. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following: <br>
<ul>
               <li>- Chest pain </li>
               <li>- Fainting or severe weakness </li>
               <li> -Rapid or irregular heartbeat associated with shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting </li>
                <li> -Sudden, severe shortness of breath and coughing up white or pink, foamy mucus </li><br>
</ul>
                
                Although these signs and symptoms may be due to heart failure, there are many other possible causes, including other life-threatening heart and lung conditions. Don't try to diagnose yourself.
                
                Emergency room doctors will try to stabilize your condition and determine if your symptoms are due to heart failure or something else.
                
                If you have a diagnosis of heart failure and if any of the symptoms suddenly become worse or you develop a new sign or symptom, it may mean that existing heart failure is getting worse or not responding to treatment. This may also be the case if you gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days. Contact your doctor promptly. <br> </p>
            </p>
            <p>1. Physician Recommendation
                If your family-care doctor recommends you see a cardiologist, do it. Don’t put it off. You’ll regret <br>
                
                2. Heart Pain
                This is pretty much a given. You can see a full list of heart disease symptoms below. If you have any doubts about whether or not you are experiencing a symptom, however, get checked out. <br>
                
                3. Family History
                If anyone in your family has or has had heart problems, you should be aware of heart disease symptoms and consider talking to a cardiologist about them. <br>
                
                4. High Total Cholesterol
                Total cholesterol is the sum of all the cholesterol in your blood. The higher your total cholesterol, the greater your risk for heart disease (a cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL or higher). <br>
                
                5. High Blood Pressure
                You have high blood pressure or a high systolic number. The systolic number on your blood pressure reading is the first number. (For example, if your reading is 120/80 (120 over 80), your systolic blood pressure is 120.) Learn how to monitor your blood pressure. <br>
                
                6. Are or Were a Smoker
                Smoking is a huge risk factor for heart disease. It lowers the flow of oxygen to the heart and increases blood pressure, heart rate, and blood clotting as well as damages the cells lining the arteries. <br>
                
                7. Diabetic
                Unfortunately diabetes can contribute to heart disease. If you experience symptoms of heart problems and are diabetic, you should see a cardiologist. <br>
                
                8. Difficult Pregnancy, Preeclampsia
                Preeclampsia is often a hidden risk factor for heart disease. The two times a woman is most likely to develop heart disease is during pregnancy or post-menopause. <br>
                
                9. Starting a New Exercise Program
                You are over the age of 40 and starting a new exercise program. You may already be working with a doctor on being more active, but a cardiologist can check your heart health and recommend exercises that would be good for your heart. <br>
                
                10. Gum Disease
                Believe it or not, gum disease can happen when the body is inflamed. Patients with swollen gums often have heart disease</p>
